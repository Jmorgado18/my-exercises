
/*Hacking Task #5
Working on the game PocketCreatures, you have been tasked with creating a 
more sophisticated way of determining damage output in the game’s battle system, 
depending on the type and weakness of both the attacking and defending creature.
When an attacking creature is weak to a defender’s type, the attacker does half
the damage. Example - a fire type will do half damage to a water type.
When the defending creature is weak to the attacker’s type, the attacker does 
double damage. Example - a fire type will do double damage to a grass type.
If they are neither weak nor strong to the other, the attacker does the baseline 
amount of damage.
You will create a function named attack() that receives an attacker and a 
defender and determines whether to return the normal damage amount, double it, 
or half it, depending on the attacker and defender type matchup.

    return damage * 2;

  if (attacker.weakness === defender.type) {
