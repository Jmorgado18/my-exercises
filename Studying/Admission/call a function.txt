Keeping inventory
Youâ€™re creating a function that will be used to print information on a 
shop item. This information includes the name or description of the item,
the category it belongs to, how much it is priced at, and how many copies
of said item exist in the shop right now.
Modify the function so that it can receive the data. The output should read:
Item: Tears of the Kingdom
Category: Video Games
Price: 59.99
Amount in Stock: 100
Then, call the function two more times with values of your choosing.
