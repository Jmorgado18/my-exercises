Hacking Task #2
Working on the game PocketCreatures, you have been tasked with designing 
a battle system. In this system, the player and an opponent battle by reducing
the otherâ€™s health by 10 each round. They continue to do this until one of them 
faints (has their health reduced to 0).
Each round they both generate a random value (between 0 and 10) to determine
whether they get a critical hit, an explosive damage. This is risky - done
correctly and they do double damage to the other, but it could also explode
in their own face. This is determined by the value generated - below 1 and 
they fail, immediately losing all their health and logging either the message 
Critical fail! Opponent has lost or Critical fail! Player has lost accordingly. 
Anything equal to 7.5 and above is a success and they do 20 damage to their
opponent rather than the usual 10.
At the end of the game, after the game loop, a message is printed revealing 
who the winner is (whoever has more health than the other): Player wins! or 
Opponent wins!. If they both have the same amount of health, the message Both
have fainted! is displayed.
Note: Maintain and use the variables playerHealth, opposingHealth, playerCrit
and opposingCrit
