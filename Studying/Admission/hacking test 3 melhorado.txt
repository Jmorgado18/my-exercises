Hacking Task #3
Working on the PocketCreatures game, you have been tasked with creating the 
ability to have teams.
Both teams should be filled with 6 random PocketCreatures of either type water,
fire or grass. Your code should use a random expression to pick a type from the 
possibilities array and add it to either the playerTeam or opponentTeam using 
the array method push.
You should print each time what type of creature both the player and opponent
got on their teams. If the creature just added to the team is the same type as 
the previous addition (for either the player team or the opponent team), then 
print Twice in a row? What are the odds! For example:
Player got fire and opponent got grass
